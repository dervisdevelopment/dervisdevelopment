- 👋 Hi, I’m Maksim Dervis (@dervisdevelopment)
- 👀 I'm generally interested in computer science, mathematics, theory of algorithms and programming
- 🌱 I am currently studying the principles of OOP and trying to learn how to organize the architecture of really large projects.
I can even say that I am always learning something, because a programmer is the kind of person who thinks he doesn't know anything and is constantly trying to figure it out
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on different interesting projects that will help me to develop my skills and just have fun 😛 Cos after all what is our life without fun ? 🤔
Therefore, I like various AI projects, unusual game ideas and just the implementation of mathematical models 
- 📫 If you suddenly have an incredibly tempting offer for me or you want to chat, write to me at dervisdevelopment@gmail.com
- 📖 I decided to list all the programming books I've read. Probably, someone will find it interesting and useful 🎁
